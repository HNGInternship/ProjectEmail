### Important repository guidelines

1.  You <strong>must</strong> create a new branch for every action you make on the repository.
2.  You <strong>must</strong> create a new branch for every HTML email template you create. Your branch's name must follow the provided format in the table below.

| Task                                     | Branch Name                       | Developer            | Reviewer    |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| Make reservation (Prepaid)               | template-make-reservation-prepaid        | @calebikhuohon       | In progress |
| template-make-reservation-pay-on-arrival | Make reservation (Pay-on-arrival) | @Philix              | In progress |
| template-issue-with-reservation          | Issue with reservation (Client)   | @nellybaz10          | In progress |

3.  In your newly created branch create a folder with a name that matches the branch name in the root folder and put your work inside there. Please do not touch anything else in the root folder.

4.  When you're done with the HTML email template, create a pull request. DM me in the #project-email channel @mclint\_, I will check that your template is responsive, matches the design and does not conflict with any other team mate's additions and then merge your branch with master.
